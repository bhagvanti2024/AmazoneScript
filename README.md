# AmazoneScript
Web Automation: Amazon search product script.

"In this post, we break down how to automate the process of adding an Amazon product to the cart step by step using Selenium."

"From navigating the Amazon mobile page, clicking to navigate to the homepage, searching for a product, and validating the results, everything is automated!"

"Want to learn how to:

Navigate to the Amazon homepage.
We use the findElement method to locate the web element.
Search for a product (e.g., Laptop HP 5G).
Wait for the results to load and validate that the search results are visible.
Then, we check whether the results are displayed using isDisplayed(). This step ensures that the product results have loaded before proceeding.
Select the first product from the search results.
Handle the new window or tab using getWindowHandles().
Add the product to the cart.
Validate the cart count and print the count using getText().
Close the window using quit(). "
